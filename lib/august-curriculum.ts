    title: 'A Note to Parents: Learning Through Conscious Discipline',
    content: "Welcome to a new month of learning! This August, we are focusing on a crucial aspect of your child's development: emotional intelligence. We will be using techniques from Conscious DisciplineÂ®, a renowned social-emotional learning framework. A key principle of this approach is that a child must be in a regulated, 'Executive State' to be able to learn and access higher-order thinking skills. That's why we will start each day with activities designed to help your child feel safe, connected, and emotionally regulated. By building this foundation first, we pave the way for a joyful and effective learning experience.",
